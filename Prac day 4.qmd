```{r}
head(flights)
dplyr::glimpse(flights)

```



```{r}
dist_tbl <- flights |>
  filter(month == 1) |>
  group_by(carrier) |>
  summarise(
    mean_distance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_distance = sd(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  arrange(mean_distance)

dist_tbl
```


# Question 3
Finding out which carriers have a standard deviation with 0 or NA. 

```{r}
# Show carriers where sd_distance is NA
dist_tbl |> filter(is.na(sd_distance))

# Show carriers where sd_distance is 0
dist_tbl |> filter(sd_distance == 0)

```

If the standard deviation is NA, this happens when a carrier has only one flight in January. The standard deviation requires at least two data points to be computed.
if the standard deviation is 0, this happens when all flights for that carrier have the same distance, leading to zero variation.


```{r}
dep_delay_df <- flights |>
  group_by(month, carrier) |>
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = carrier, values_from = avg_dep_delay)  # Reshape to wide format

dep_delay_df
```
